# üóÉÔ∏è Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles! This repository is designed to work seamlessly with
[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), allowing you to easily manage
your dotfiles across multiple machines.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Modular setup**: Allows you to manage separate configurations for different
  software in individual directories.
- **No clutter**: Keeps your home directory clean by only creating symbolic links
  to configuration files, instead of copying files directly.
