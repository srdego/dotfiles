# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles! This repository is designed to work seamlessly with GNU Stow, allowing you to easily manage your dotfiles across multiple machines.

The repository is organized into various directories, each corresponding to a particular configuration file or set of files. You can simply clone the repository and then use Stow to symlink the appropriate directories to your home directory.
